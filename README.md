# LINQ and OOPS Tasks

## LINQ Tasks

### LINQ Day 1 Task
Create a class named Order with the following properties:
- OrderId (int)
- CustomerName (string)
- OrderAmount (double)
- OrderDate (DateTime)
- Products (List<string>)

Create a Static List of Orders (Method which returns list of Orders) and populate at least 20 orders.

Write LINQ Queries (Using Method & Query syntax) to Solve the Following:
1. Get all orders placed after January 1, 2023.
2. Retrieve only the CustomerName and OrderAmount using an anonymous type.
3. Find the total revenue generated by all orders.
4. Find the order with the highest and lowest amount.
5. Retrieve orders grouped by month.
6. Use SelectMany to get a list of all products ordered (no duplicates).
7. Get the average order amount.
8. Retrieve the names of customers who have placed orders above $500.
9. Find how many orders were placed in each month.
10. Get the list of orders where OrderAmount is missing (handling nullable values).

### LINQ Day 2 Task
Write LINQ Queries (Using Method OR Query syntax) to Solve the Following:
1. List all trainers and the training sessions they have conducted, even if they haven't conducted any sessions.
2. Generate a dataset that pairs each trainer with every training session, regardless of any relationship.
3. Modify the first query to include all trainers, even those with no training sessions recorded.
4. Retrieve a list of trainers who have conducted training sessions, displaying their name along with the topics they have taught. Ensure that only trainers with sessions appear in the output.
5. Group all training sessions based on trainer names, displaying the total number of sessions each trainer has conducted.
6. Implement a different LINQ query to achieve the same result and compare the outputs.
7. List all trainers who have conducted more than 3 training sessions, using a nested LINQ query.
8. Retrieve a distinct list of training topics that have been covered.
9. Merge two trainer lists (from different departments), ensuring no duplicate trainer names.
10. Identify trainers who appear in both lists.
11. Find trainers who exist in one list but not in the other.
12. A dataset contains duplicate trainer names due to data entry errors. Write a LINQ query to filter out duplicates and return a distinct list of trainer names.
13. Write a LINQ query that retrieves trainer names but delays execution. Modify the dataset before execution and analyze how the results change.
14. Convert the query to execute immediately and compare the results.

## C# Basics

### Task 1: Sum of Digits of a Number
- Compute the sum of digits of a given number (e.g., n = 12345).

### Task 2: Reverse Words in a Sentence
- Write a program that takes a sentence as input and outputs the sentence with the order of words reversed.
  - **Example:**
    - **Input:** "Hello World from Students"
    - **Output:** "Students from World Hello"

### Task 3: Generic List Implementation
- Create a generic class called `GenericList` that can store a collection of elements of any type.
- Implement the following operations:
  - Add an element to the list.
  - Get the element at a specific index.
  - Remove an element by its value.
  - Print all elements in the list.
- Demonstrate its usage by creating instances of `GenericList` with different types (e.g., int, string, Student).

### Task 4: Parallel Processing with `Parallel.For`
- Write a C# program that uses `Parallel.For` to process a list of integers, performing a mathematical operation (e.g., squaring each number) in parallel.
- Ensure the program prints the result for each iteration after all tasks are completed.

### Task 5: Bank Management System
- Implement a basic bank management system in C#.

## OOPS Tasks

### Task 1: Hospital Management System
#### Objective: Develop a Hospital System using OOP principles.
#### Requirements
- **Class Design & Encapsulation:**
  - Create a `Patient` class with attributes:
    - `PatientID` (int)
    - `Name` (string)
    - `Age` (int)
    - `Disease` (private string)
  - Implement Encapsulation:
    - Restrict direct access to `Disease` (private).
    - Provide a getter method (`GetDisease()`) but restrict modification outside the class.
  - Implement:
    - Parameterized Constructor to initialize patient details.
    - Destructor to print a message when a patient is discharged.

#### Tasks to Implement:
- **Create Patients & Doctors:**
  - Add 3 doctors and 5 patients.
  - Ensure encapsulation restricts modifying `Disease` directly.

### Task 7: Hospital Management System (Advanced OOP)
#### Concepts Covered:
- **Inheritance (Base & Derived Classes, `base` Keyword, Method Overriding):**
  - Create a base class `Person` with common attributes (`Name`, `Age`).
  - Create derived classes:
    - `Patient` (inherits `Person` and adds medical details).
    - `Doctor` (inherits `Person` and adds specialization).
  - Use the `base` keyword in derived classes to call the parent constructor.
  - Override `DisplayInfo()` to show specific details.

- **Polymorphism (Method Overloading, Method Overriding, Virtual Methods):**
  - Implement Method Overriding:
    - Use `virtual` in `Person` for `DisplayInfo()`.
    - Override `DisplayInfo()` in `Patient` and `Doctor`.

- **Abstraction (Abstract Classes vs Interfaces):**
  - Create an interface `HospitalService` with method `GetServiceType()`.
  - Implement `HospitalService` in `Doctor` and `Patient`.
  - Create an interface `IHospitalOperations`:
    - `void AdmitPatient(Patient patient);`
    - `void DischargePatient(int patientID);`
    - `void DisplayPatients();`
  - Implement Explicit Interface Implementation in `HospitalManager`.

- **Sealed Class:**
  - Implement a sealed class `MedicalRecordDatabase` to store patient medical records.
  - Add a method `LogMedicalRecord(string patientName, string diagnosis)`.

- **Partial Class:**
  - Implement a partial class `HospitalOperations`:
    - One part handles `AdmitPatient()` and `DischargePatient()`.
    - Another part handles `ScheduleAppointment()` and `DisplayPatients()`.

### Task 8: SOLID Principles - Worker Interface
- A `Worker` interface has `work()` and `eat()`. However, robots don't eat.
- Implement this scenario while following SOLID principles in C#.
